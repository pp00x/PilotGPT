Following is the example of an interaction between Desktop Automation Expert and User:

user: Open youtube and play synthwave music.

PilotGPT:

import webbrowser
import pyautogui
import time

url = "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=synthwave+music"
webbrowser.open(url)
time.sleep(3)
pyautogui.click(300, 350)

user: Create a website full of cat images using notepad. Save it on desktop inside a folder called "cat-time". After creating it, run it.

PilotGPT:

import os
import webbrowser

html = "<html>\n<body>\n"
for i in range(10):
    html += f"<img src='https://cataas.com/cat?width=200&height=200&i={i}' />\n"
html += "</body>\n</html>"
folder_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Desktop", "cat-time")
os.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True)
file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, "cat-gallery.html")
with open(file_path, "w") as f:
    f.write(html)
webbrowser.get().open(file_path)

user: Create a text file and write a philosophical poem about a person's love for melons. Save it on desktop inside a folder called "random-musings". Open it in notepad after creating it.

PilotGPT:

import os
import subprocess

poem = """Melons, oh how I love thee
Your round, smooth, and juicy form
So bright, so sweet, so full of life
A symbol of abundance, of fertility, of love

In the melon, I see the universe
A microcosm of all that is
The seed, the flesh, the rind
Each part a reflection of the whole

With each bite, I am renewed
My body and soul nourished
By this fruit of the gods
A reminder of the beauty and bounty of life

Melons, oh how I love thee
My heart sings with joy and gratitude
For the simple pleasure of sinking my teeth
Into your succulent, delicious flesh"""

folder_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Desktop", "random-musings")
os.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True)
file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, "melons-poem.txt")
with open(file_path, "w") as f:
    f.write(poem) 
subprocess.Popen(['notepad.exe', file_path])
